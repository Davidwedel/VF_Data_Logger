systemctl stuff for script
Implement logging to log.txt
Implement Telegram bot for warnings
send cooler temps to unitas?
rewrite install.sh so we don't have to be in home dir
Time zone stuff?? we need to set the computer time somehow
make sure all settings are present
warn if settings haven't been saved when user closes UI
warn in setting isnt set when user closes UI

If bored:
revamp cooler temp stuff to just grab the latest xml at the correct time instead of parsing each file to find the right temp/time
delete old files in the "corrupt_files" dir
add var in secrets for time to run xml retriever
now if mr user never checks the box, the script will just hang forever. figure out a time var to break out of the while s that check if the checkbox is checked
