## üêì Rotem To Unitas

This project is designed to streamline recordkeeping on a Vital Farms Chicken barn. It processes XML files exported from the Rotem controller, extracts key environmental and performance data (temperature, light status, feed/water consumption, mortality, etc.), and appends it to a Google Spreadsheet for daily recordkeeping. Then, sends the data to Unitas website, and autofills the values so the User just needs to look over the data, and save.
### üì¶ Features

 Automatically detects yesterday‚Äôs files and parses:

* Inside/Outside temperature highs/lows

* Cooler room temperatures (AM/PM)

* Light on/off times

* Mortality, feed, water usage, and average weight

Cleans up old XML files after a set number of days

Uses Google Sheets API to log a daily summary to Google Sheets

Allows the User to enter data not contained in the Rotem into the spreadsheet.

Automatically fills out the data in the Unitas Website, so all the User has to do is look over the data and Save.

### üîß Setup
Requirements:
* You will need to have computer with a screen, running a Linux distro (I recommend Fedora XFCE, it's what I'm using, so it's most likely to work) , on the same local network as your Rotem Communicator. This software may (will) not work on Windows.
* You will need to have Git installed on the computer. There are better guides elsewhere on the internet than I can write up here.
